# HW7: Trip Planner
#
# ** You must work on your own for this assignment. **

# Your program will most likely need a number of data structures, many of
# which you've implemented in previous homeworks.
# We have provided you with compiled versions of homework 3, 4, 5, and 6
# solutions. You can import them as you did in homework 6.
# Be sure to extract the `hw7-lib` archive is the same directory as this file.
# You may also import libraries from the DSSL2 standard library (e.g., cons,
# array, etc.).

import cons

#Honor Code

### Basic Vocabulary Types ###

#  - Latitudes and longitudes are numbers:
let Lat?  = num?
let Lon?  = num?
#  - Point-of-interest categories and names are strings:
let Cat?  = str?
let Name? = str?

# ListC[T] is a list of `T`s (linear time):
let ListC = Cons.ListC

# List of unspecified element type (constant time):
let List? = Cons.list?


### Input Types ###

#  - a SegmentVector  is VecC[SegmentRecord]
#  - a PointVector    is VecC[PointRecord]
# where
#  - a SegmentRecord  is [Lat?, Lon?, Lat?, Lon?]
#  - a PointRecord    is [Lat?, Lon?, Cat?, Name?]


### Output Types ###

#  - a NearbyList     is ListC[PointRecord]; i.e., one of:
#                       - None
#                       - cons(PointRecord, NearbyList)
#  - a PositionList   is ListC[Position]; i.e., one of:
#                       - None
#                       - cons(Position, PositionList)
# where
#  - a PointRecord    is [Lat?, Lon?, Cat?, Name?]  (as above)
#  - a Position       is [Lat?, Lon?]


# Interface for trip routing and searching:
interface TRIP_PLANNER:
    # Finds no more than `n` points-of-interest of the given category
    # nearest to the source position. (Ties for nearest are broken
    # arbitrarily.)
    def find_nearby(
            self,
            src_lat:  Lat?,     # starting latitude
            src_lon:  Lon?,     # starting longitude
            dst_cat:  Cat?,     # point-of-interest category
            n:        nat?      # maximum number of results
        )   ->        List?     # list of nearby POIs (NearbyList)

    # Finds the shortest route, if any, from the given source position
    # (latitude and longitude) to the point-of-interest with the given
    # name. (Returns `None` if no path can be found.)
    def find_route(
            self,
            src_lat:  Lat?,     # starting latitude
            src_lon:  Lon?,     # starting longitude
            dst_name: Name?     # name of goal
        )   ->        List?     # path to goal (PositionList)
